The goal is to get a basic understanding of the chrome extension api by designing a simple dashboard
available on new tab creation, work in progress ( inspiration: momentum dashboard :D ).

## install

* go to chrome://extensions/
* click on load unpack extension (if it's not there be sure to have developper mode checked)
* select what you just cloned
* try to enjoy
